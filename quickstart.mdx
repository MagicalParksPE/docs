The majority of Minecraft servers we deploy run on **AMD EPYC** processors, which are known for their high thread count and performance. This means we can run many servers on a single machine. You might even have a chance of your server being created on an **AMD Ryzen** machine, with even higher performance, which we have a few of too.

We then use **NVMe SSDs** for storage while servers are running, which offer great read/write speeds, but store your servers on high-capacity **HDDs** when not in use.
